Development and deployment workflow for your project‚Äîcomprising **Next.js**, **Strapi**, and **PostgreSQL**‚Äîwith live hosting on **Coolify**, local development capabilities, and seamless GitHub integration

---

## üß± Architectural Overview

- **Strapi (Backend CMS)**: Deployed on Coolify, providing a live admin panel for clients to manage content.
- **Next.js (Frontend Application)**: Developed locally for rapid iteration and testing.
- **PostgreSQL (Database)**: Hosted on Coolify, serving as the data store for Strapi.
- **Docker Desktop**: Facilitates containerized local development, ensuring consistency across environments.
- **Docker Hub**: Acts as a container registry to store and distribute Docker images.
- **GitHub**: Central repository for version control and integration with Coolify for automated deployments.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Workflow

### 1. **Local Development with Docker Desktop**

Utilize Docker Desktop to mirror your production environment locally:

- **Strapi**: Run a local instance to develop and test new components.
- **Next.js**: Develop the frontend, fetching data from the local Strapi instance.
- **PostgreSQL**: Use a local database container to simulate production data interactions.

This setup ensures that your local development environment closely resembles the production setup, reducing discrepancies and deployment issues.

### 2. **Version Control and Continuous Integration with GitHub**

Maintain your project's codebase on GitHub:

- **Branching Strategy**: Use feature branches for development and merge into the main branch upon completion.
- **Pull Requests**: Implement code reviews and testing before merging changes.
- **GitHub Actions**: Set up workflows for automated testing and linting to maintain code quality.

### 3. **Container Registry with Docker Hub**

Leverage Docker Hub to store and manage your Docker images:

- **Image Building**: Build Docker images for Strapi and Next.js locally.
- **Tagging**: Use semantic versioning for image tags to track releases.
- **Pushing to Registry**: Push images to Docker Hub for accessibility by Coolify during deployment. ([Docker image for strapi v4 (latest version) - GitHub](https://github.com/naskio/docker-strapi?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Simple Coolify example with Docker Compose + Github](https://dev.to/mandrasch/simple-coolify-example-with-docker-compose-github-deployments-53m?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 4. **Deployment with Coolify**

Deploy your applications using Coolify's integration capabilities:

- **GitHub Integration**: Connect your GitHub repository to Coolify for automated deployments upon code changes.
- **Docker Compose**: Define your services (Strapi, Next.js, PostgreSQL) in a `docker-compose.yml` file for orchestrated deployment.
- **Environment Variables**: Configure necessary environment variables within Coolify for each service. ([Build Server | Coolify Docs](https://coolify.io/docs/builds/servers?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## üîÑ Synchronizing Local and Production Environments

To ensure a smooth workflow between local development and the live environment:

1. **Develop Locally**: Create and test new Strapi components and Next.js features using Docker Desktop.
2. **Version Control**: Commit and push changes to the appropriate GitHub branches.
3. **Continuous Deployment**: Upon merging to the main branch, Coolify detects changes and redeploys the updated services using the latest Docker images from Docker Hub.
4. **Client Access**: Clients can access the live Strapi admin panel hosted on Coolify to manage content without interfering with ongoing development.

## ‚úÖ Benefits of This Approach

- **Consistency**: Docker ensures that your local and production environments are identical, minimizing "it works on my machine" issues.
- **Efficiency**: Automated deployments via Coolify and GitHub streamline the release process.
- **Scalability**: Using Docker Hub allows for easy scaling and distribution of your application containers.
- **Client Empowerment**: Hosting the Strapi admin panel on Coolify provides clients with real-time content management capabilities.

By integrating Docker Desktop, Docker Hub, GitHub, and Coolify into your development and deployment workflow, you establish a robust, scalable, and efficient system that supports both your development needs and your clients' content management requirements.
